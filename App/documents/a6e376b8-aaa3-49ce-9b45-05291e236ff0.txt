University of Wollongong in Dubai CSIT242 - Mobile Application Development Android Widgets (progress bar, seek bar, Date and Time Picker Dialogs) Lesson 8 from Android ATC Team. (2021). Android application development (12th ed.). Android ATC. Dr. Haitham Yaish 2 Document Change Control 3 Outline 4 Progress Bar (ProgressBar) Seek Bar (SeekBar) Date and Time Picker Dialogs 5 Progress Bar (ProgressBar) ProgressBar 6 The ProgressBar is a class used as a user interface element to indicate the progress of an operation. The Progress bar class supports two modes of progress: determinate and indeterminate. Indeterminate Progress It is used when you do not know how much time an operation will take. The Indeterminate mode shows a cyclic animation without indicating the amount of progress made ProgressBar 7 Determinate Progress (Horizontal) The determinate mode of the progress bar is used when you want to show how much progress has been made. For example, the percent remaining of a file being retrieved, the amount records in a batch written to database, or the remaining percent of an audio file that is playing. 8 Example: Open the activity_main.xml in Design mode and Delete the �Hello World!� TextView. Add a button to the activity, and set its text attribute value to: Download. Set the button Id attribute value to: downloadBtn ProgressBar 9 Example: From the Palette panel (Widgets) drag a �ProgressBar (Horizontal)� and drop into your activity. Set the attribute values of the ProgressBar as illustrated in the following figure: ProgressBar 10 Example: Add a button to the activity, and set its text attribute value to: Stop. Set the button Id attribute value to: stopBtn. ProgressBar Note: The full code of activity_main.xml file is provided in the slide note of this slide. 11 Example: Add this code to the MainActivity file. You can find it in the slide note. ProgressBar Add a variable �progressBarStatus =0� which represents the download process from 0% to 100%, where the starting value is �0�. Add variable �rate =0� which represents the filling process of the progress bar. 12 Example: Add this code to the MainActivity file. You can find it in the slide note. ProgressBar This code of the while loop which displays the changes in the progress bar every 500 milliseconds. This code will hide your progress bar when you tap the Stop button. 13 Example: Execute the application using the emulator. ProgressBar Start the progressbar The progressbar is working You can click the Stop button to stop the progressbar The progressbar stopped and terminated 14 Example: Change this progress bar to an indeterminate progress bar, you can open the activity_main.xml in Code mode and add the following XML attribute: android:indeterminate=�true� to the ProgressBar tag as illustrated in the following XML code. ProgressBar Note: The full code of activity_main.xml file is provided in the slide note of this slide. 15 Seek Bar (SeekBar) SeekBar 16 A SeekBar is an extension of the ProgressBar with a draggable thumb. The app user can touch the thumb and drag it left or right to set the current progress level or he/she can use the arrow keys. Placing focusable widgets to the left or right of a SeekBar is discourage. 17 Example: Create a new project. Open the activity_main.xml in Design mode and Delete the �Hello World!� TextView. From the Palette panel (Widgets) drag a SeekBar widget and drop into your activity. Set the SeekBar constraints and configure its attributes values as follows: SeekBar 18 Example: Add a TextView widget to your activity which will be used later to display the SeekBar values. Set its constraints and change the TextView widget attributes as follows: SeekBar Note: The full code of activity_main.xml file is provided in the slide note of this slide. 19 Example: Add this code to the MainActivity file. You can find it in the slide note. In Android Studio (Kotlin development), lateinit is a keyword used to declare late-initialized properties. It allows you to define a non-nullable variable without initializing it immediately. SeekBar 20 Example: Add this code to the MainActivity file. You can find it in the slide note. SeekBar 21 Example: Execute the application using the emulator. SeekBar Initial State Once changing the SeekBar Once stop changing the SeekBar 22 Date and Time Picker Dialogs 23 Android provides controls for the user to pick a time or pick a date as ready-to-use dialogs. Each picker provides controls for selecting each part of the time (hour, minute, AM/PM) or date (month, day, year). Using these pickers helps ensure that your users can pick a time or date that is valid, formatted correctly, and adjusted to the user�s location. Date and Time Picker Dialogs 24 Creating a Date Picker Example: Create a new project. Open the activity_main.xml in Design mode and Delete the �Hello World!� TextView. Add a button to the activity, and set its text attribute value to: Date. Set the button Id attribute value to: dateBtn 25 Creating a Date Picker Example: Add a TextView widget to the activity_main.xml file. Set its constraints, and then configure its attribute values as follows: Note: The full code of activity_main.xml file is provided in the slide note of this slide. 26 Example: Add this code to the MainActivity file. You can find it in the slide note. Creating a Date Picker The date format 27 Creating a Date Picker Example: Execute the application using the emulator. Initial State Displaying the Calendar Displaying the date into the TextView 28 Creating a Time Picker Example: Continue using the same project. Add a button to the activity, and set its text attribute value to: Time. Set the button Id attribute value to: timeBtn 29 Creating a Time Picker Example: Add a TextView widget to your activity_main.xml file. Set its constraints and then configure its attributes values as follows: Delete the text attribute value of this �TextView� or set it with a blank value. The activity will look like the figure Note: The full code of activity_main.xml file is provided in the slide note of this slide. 30 Example: Add this code to the MainActivity file. You can find it in the slide note. Creating a Time Picker 31 Example: Add this code to the MainActivity file. You can find it in the slide note. The time format Creating a Time Picker 32 Example: Execute the application using the emulator. Creating a Time Picker After pressing the Time Button Initial State After selecting the hour and minutes After pressing the Ok button Android ATC Team. (2021).
