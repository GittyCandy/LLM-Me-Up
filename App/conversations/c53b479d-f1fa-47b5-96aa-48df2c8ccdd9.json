Gather your supplies: You'll need freshly roasted coffee beans, a burr grinder, a kettle or pot to heat water, and a French press or drip coffee maker.\r\n2. Grind the coffee beans: Using a burr grinder, grind the coffee beans to your desired consistency. A medium grind is ideal for drip coffee makers, while a coarse grind is better for French presses.\r\n3. Heat the water: Bring cold water to a boil (just under boiling point is best) and let it sit for about 30 seconds before pouring it over the coffee grounds.\r\n4. Combine the coffee and water: In your French press or coffee maker, add the freshly ground coffee and pour the hot water over it. Make sure all the grounds are soaked.\r\n5. Steep the coffee: Allow the coffee to steep for about 3-4 minutes (or longer if you prefer a stronger brew).\r\n6. Press and serve: For French presses, slowly press down on the plunger to separate the brewed coffee from the grounds. Pour the coffee into your cup and enjoy! If using a drip coffee maker, simply pour the brewed coffee into your cup.",

You can add more complex functionalities using JavaScript or integrate with any backend services for data management and renting processes. Please replace \"https://via.placeholder.com/350x200\" with actual image URLs to display your rental properties.\r\n",
