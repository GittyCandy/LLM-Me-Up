      "content": "Sure, here's a basic example of how you might structure your HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend), and Node.js (backend) files for a coffee webpage. This is quite simplified and doesn't cover all possible functionalities. You would need to add more features like user authentication, payment gateway integration etc., based on your requirements.\r\n\r\n1. **HTML**\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles/style.css\">\r\n    <title>Coffee Webpage</title>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n    <h1>Welcome to our Coffee Shop!</h1>\r\n    <div id=\"coffeeList\"></div>\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"/scripts/main.js\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n2. **CSS (style.css)**\r\n```css\r\nbody {\r\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nh1 {\r\n    color: #333;\r\n}\r\n#coffeeList {\r\n    margin-top: 20px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. **JavaScript (main.js)**\r\nThis file would make a fetch request to your Node.js server to get the coffee data, and then populate the page with that data. Assuming you have an API endpoint at `/api/coffees`.\r\n```javascript\r\nfetch('/api/coffees')\r\n    .then(response => response.json())\r\n    .then(data => {\r\n        const coffeeList = document.getElementById('coffeeList');\r\n        data.forEach(coffee => {\r\n            const coffeeItem = document.createElement('div');\r\n            coffeeItem.innerHTML = `<h2>${coffee.name}</h2><p>${coffee.description}</p>`;\r\n            coffeeList.appendChild(coffeeItem);\r\n        });\r\n    })\r\n    .catch(error => console.log('Error:', error));\r\n```\r\n4. **Node.js (server.js)**\r\nThis would be a very basic Node.js server that serves the static files and has an API endpoint for fetching coffee data. It uses Express, but you could use any other framework or standalone http module as well.\r\n```javascript\r\nconst express = require('express');\r\nconst app = express();\r\nconst port = 3000;\r\n\r\n// Serve static files from the public directory\r\napp.use(express.static('public'));\r\n\r\n// API endpoint for getting coffee data (for simplicity, we'll just use a hardcoded array here)\r\napp.get('/api/coffees', (req, res) => {\r\n    const coffees = [\r\n        {name: 'Coffee 1', description: 'Description of Coffee 1'},\r\n        // Add more coffee data as needed...\r\n    ];\r\n    res.json(coffees);\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`));\r\n```\r\nThis is a very basic example and you would need to expand upon it according to your needs. It's recommended to use more robust solutions for frontend state management (e.g., Redux) and backend server setup (e.g., Express, Koa), but this should give you a starting point.\r\n",
