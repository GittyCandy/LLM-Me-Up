Education: Promote awareness and understanding of sexual orientation in schools.\r\n2. Legal protection: Ensure laws protect individuals from discrimination based on sexual orientation.\r\n3. Inclusion: Encourage businesses and organizations to include diverse representation in marketing and advertising.\r\n4. Support networks: Strengthen resources for people coming out or struggling with their identity.\r\n5. Mental health care: Increase access to mental health services for those dealing with the stress of societal stigma.",
