Understanding Network Protocols
Anetwork protocol isused forcommunication
between entities indifferent systems
Fortwoentities tocommunicate successfully, they 
must "speak the same language."
•What iscommunicated? Data andinformation
•How itiscommunicated? Rules andstandards
•When itiscommunicated? Timing andsynchronization
Layered Approach toCommunication
•Simplifying complex communication tasks bydividing
them intolayers
•Utilizing multiple protocols, each tailored foraspecific
layer

Example
Assume Maria andAnn areneighbors with alotofcommon
ideas .However, Maria speaks only Spanish, and Ann
speaks only English .Since both have learned thesign
language intheir childhood, they enjoy meeting ina
cafe acouple ofdays per week and exchange their
ideas using signs .Communication isface toface and
happens inonelayer.

Example Contd..
Now assume that Ann has tomove toanother town
because ofherjob. Before she moves, thetwo meet for
thelast time inthesame cafe. Although both are sad,
Maria surprises Ann when she opens apacket that
contains two small machines .The first machine can scan
and transform aletter inEnglish toasecret code orvice
versa .The other machine canscan andtranslate aletter in
Spanish tothesame secret code orvice versa .Ann takes
thefirst machine; Maria keeps thesecond one. The two
friends canstillcommunicate using thesecret code.

OSI:Theseven layer model
OSI
•is an abbreviation of Open Systems Interconnection.
•dates back to 1983 and was released by ISO .
Layer Distinction
•Upper Layers (Layers 5- 7): local and associated with 
end-user applications
•Lower Layers (Layers 1- 4): relate to network and 
communication services

TCP/IP Suite
TCP/IP suite was developed prior totheOSI
model.
Layers inthe TCP/IP protocol suite donotmatch
exactly withthose intheOSImodel.
Theoriginal TCP/IP protocol suite wasdefined as
fourlayers
Modern TCP/IP model is thought ofasa five-
layer model
•Internet layer in original suite is divided into 2 
layers: network layer and data link layer

Routing and Addressing in Computer Networks
12
Network Addressing
Each device (e.g.,PC) onanetwork requires a
unique address toensure proper identification
andcommunication
Each application requires aunique address within
the device .Otherwise, multiple applications
cannot runsimultaneously
13
Addressing in the TCP/IP Model
Four levels ofaddresses are used in 
anetwork employing theTCP/IP protocols:
•physical address (MAC),
•logical address (IP),
•port address, and
•application- specific address.
Each address isrelated toaonelayer in
theTCP/IP architecture

(Numerical format)Before TodayData products information
Information (knowledge) allows toobtain benefits
(financial, social, political, …etc ).
“Knowledge ispower “Francis Bacon, aFrench philosopher .Information Security -Why ?
28
Cybersecurity isasubcategory ofinformation security
thataims toensure thesecurity ofdata thatisfound ina
digital form. Itdeals primarily with theprotection of
internet -connected systems, including hardware,
software, anddata.
Network Security :isasubset ofcybersecurity, focusing
specifically on the protection ofthe networking
infrastructure .Itinvolves protecting thedata asitis
transmitted across orbetween networks.
29Cyber Security & Network Security
The CIA Triad
Confidentiality, Integrity and 
Availability are the fundamentals 
principals of information 
security: 
•Primary goals of any security policy
•Used to evaluate vulnerabilities and risks
•Used to evaluate security controls
The CIA Triade is a concise reference  to Confidentiality, 
Integrity, and Availability  
Confidentiality
Integrity
Information 
Security
Availability
30
Protection ofdata ortraffic from disclosure or
unauthorized access .Itensures that only those
withproper authorization canaccess data/traffic.
Confidentiality canbeenforced using e.g.,:
•Encryption: using cryptographic algorithms to convert sensitive 
data into an unreadable format
•Access Controls: allowing access to data or resources uniquely 
after performing authentication  and authorization.
31Violations ofconfidentiality arenot limited todirected intentional attacks .They can bethe
result ofhuman error, oversight, orineptitude .Confidentiality
Protection ofdata from unauthorized modifications,
ensuring data remains accurate andcomplete throughout
itslifecycle .
Integrity canbeenforced using e.g.:
•Hash Functions: generating unique hash values using 
cryptographic algorithms.
•Digital signature: Applying cryptographic signatures to hashed data.
•Access Controls: Restricting access to data and systems to 
authorized users only.
32Violations ofintegrity arenotlimited todirected intentional attacks .They can betheresult of
human error, oversight, orineptitude .Integrity
33The accessibility ofresources (e.g.,network and
services) toauthorized users when needed, ensuring
these resources areoperational and functional, with
minimal downtime anddisruptions .
Availability canbeenforced using e.g.:
•Redundancy and Failover Mechanisms: if one component fails, 
another can take over seamlessly. 
•DDoS Protection: Deploying DDoS (Distributed Denial of 
Service) protection mechanisms.
33Violations ofavailability arenotlimited todirected intentional attacks .They can betheresult
ofhuman error, oversight, orineptitude .Availability
Usage Control
Anemerging concept thatcomplements thetraditional CIA
triad.
Itextends access control bynotonly defining who can
access information butalso how that information canbe
used after access hasbeen granted.
Itfocuses oncontrolling theactions thatcanbeperformed
ondata even after ithasbeen accessed ordistributed .
34
CIA Triad and Usage Control: Real- World Example
A company collects personal information from users, such 
as their email addresses, for the specific purpose of sending them a newsletter.
•Confidentiality :ensures that only authorized
personnel canaccess theemail addresses .
•Integrity :ensures thattheemail addresses arestored
and transmitted correctly, without unauthorized
modification.
•Availability :email addresses areaccessible tothe
newsletter system whenever needed.
•Usage Control: ensures thattheemail addresses are
used only forsending newsletters and notforother
purposes, likemarketing unrelated products orselling
thedata tothird parties .
35
Even with strong measures toensure Confidentiality,
Integrity, Availability, and Usage Control, potential risks
canstillthreaten these protections .
Origins of“Risk ”
•The word "Risk" stems from theItalian word “risicare ,”which
means navigating among dangerous rocks .
•This implies making decisions incontexts ofuncertainty .
Arisk can beidentified byanswering thefollowing
questions :
•What isthefeared event?
•What istheprobability ofthishappening?
•What arethepotential consequences/impacts?
36Understanding Cybersecurity Risks

Cybers ecurity Threats
Threat Sources:
•External Threats (Outsider): Hackers, cybercriminals, state -
sponsored actors
•Internal Threats (Insider) :Disgruntled ordishonest employees,
accidental breaches
•Third- Party Threats :Vendors, contractors, orservice providers
Threat Classifications:
•Human- Caused Threats (>55%):Insider threats, Phishing attacks

40
Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, 
network, or process that can be exploited by an attacker.
Common Vulnerabilities:
•Software Vulnerabilities :e.g.,Unpatched OS, poorly configured
firewall, misconfigured permissions, unnecessary orimproperly
secured open ports .
•Hardware Vulnerabilities :e.g.,insecure network hardware or
outdated firmware.
•Human Vulnerabilities :e.g.,Social engineering, lack ofsecurity
awareness among staff
41
Vulnerabilities and the CVE Format
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE): 
Asystem thatprovides standardized identifiers forknown vulnerabilities in
software andhardware .Each vulnerability gets aunique CVE IDforeasy
tracking andreference .
Format & Terms:
•CVE-YYYY-NNNNN (e.g.,CVE-2024 -12345 ):YYYY refers totheyear
when thevulnerability wasreported, andNNNNN isaunique identifier .
•CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) :Asystem for
measuring theseverity ofavulnerability, typically scored from 0to10.
•Exploit :Refers toamethod ortool used totake advantage ofa
vulnerability inasystem.
•Patch :Asecurity update provided bythevendor tofixavulnerability .
•Zero -Day:Avulnerability thatisexploited before thevendor isaware of
itorbefore apatch isavailable.
42
CVE Databases
NVD (National Vulnerability Database): Managed by NIST (National 
Institute of Standards and Technology), NVD extends CVE with detailed vulnerability information and CVSS scores.
•NVD’s may shift toward encouraging Common Vulnerability and
Exposure (CVE) issuers (known asCNAs) toinclude CVSS scores
directly, reducing the NVD's burden ofre-analyzing and scoring
vulnerabilities .
MITRE’s CVE List: The official registry for all CVEs, managed by MITRE.
CIRCL (Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg): Offers advanced search features and access to CVE information.

43
Risk Concepts
Likelihood: isthefrequency orchance ofthethreat occurring .It
depends on:
•Motivation, opportunity andmeans ofthethreatening agent,
•Robustness ofsecurity measures (e.g.,IDS, Firewalls)
Impact :isthelevel ofseverity ofthepotential consequences onthe
organization following therealization ofathreat .
Impact must consider theasset value estimated bythebusiness
owner
Information security risk:Defined asthepossibility that athreat will
exploit vulnerabilities inanasset orgroup ofassets, causing harm tothe
organization (ISO/IEC 27005 ).
Risk Level =  Likelihood  X  Impact 
44Cybersecurity Risk: Terminology Cont.
Impact Classification in Cybersecurity
Impact refers to the potential consequences or severity of damage 
caused by a threat exploiting a vulnerability in a system or network.
Standards like ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800 -53 provides framework to 
asses the impact severity level.
Impact severity levels: 
■Low: Limited damage toanorganization's operations, assets, orindividuals .
Operational processes may continue without serious interruption.
■Moderate/Medium :Significant butmanageable disruption orharm tothe
organization. The attack may cause operational delays, butrecovery is
achievable.
■High: Severe damage affecting amajor partoftheorganization’s operations .
Financial, reputational, andlegal damages canbesubstantial.
■Critical :Catastrophic consequences that could potentially threaten the
survival oftheorganization. Long-term operational disruption, major loss of
public trust, orlegal penalties may occur.
45
46Security Attacks: Know Your Adversaries
White Hat Hackers: Ethical hackers who help organizations improve 
their security by identifying vulnerabilities.
Black Hat Hackers: Malicious actors who exploit systems for personal 
gain or to cause damage.
Gray Hat Hackers: Individuals who operate between ethical and 
malicious hacking; they might breach systems without permission but often 
claim to help by identifying flaws.
Red Hat Hackers: they target black hats using hacking methods to 
disrupt or retaliate against malicious hacking attempts.
Script Kiddies: Unskilled individuals using pre-made hacking tools or 
scripts, with little understanding of the underlying techniques.
Hacktivists: Hackers driven by political or ideological causes, using their 
skills to promote their beliefs, often targeting governments or corporations.
State -Sponsored Hackers: Hackers working for government entities to 
conduct espionage, sabotage, or intelligence gathering, often against other nations. 
46
Security Attacks: Think Like A Hacker
Security is probably more difficult than most 
technological problems
■Security is about ensuring that bad thing snever 
happen, while other technologies efforts are concerned 
with ensuring that something good happens.
■The hardest thing is convincing yourself that you’ve thought of all possible scenarios, before your adversaries think of them.
■You need to find and mitigate all exploitable vulnerabilities; your adversaries only need to find one ! 
47
Principle of easiest penetration
An adversaire must be expected to use 
any available means of penetration.
The penetration mean may not be the most 
obvious one, nor against the part of the system 
where most solid defense has been installed
“Agood attack isonethattheengineers never thought
of.”
Bruce Schneier
48
Security Attacks: MOM Approach
Method
•Skills, knowledge, tools, etc.required tolaunch theattack
Opportunity
•Thetime andaccess(e.g.,vulnerability) tolaunch theattack
Motive
•Areason toperform theattack
49
Risk Concepts
Aprotective technical ororganizational measure/action
designed toremove orreduce therisklevel.
•Does noteliminate thethreat itself, butreduces thelikelihood ofit
exploiting vulnerabilities and/or minimizes theimpact .
•Must satisfy asecurity objective (e.g.,limiting access tosensitive
information) .
•The cost ofthe control should beless than the potential
consequences oftherisk.
Categories ofsecurity controls:
•Organizational eg.,security policies .
•Human ex.training anduser education.
•Physical eg.,barriers, security guards, alarms .
•Technological eg.,IDS, Firewall, Encryption .Cybersecurity Risk: Understanding Security Controls
50
Risk Concepts
Preventive (e.g.,Firewalls, Security Guard) :tostop security incidents
before they occur .
Detective (e.g.,Alarms, Enforcing Staff Vacations) :Toidentify and
detect security incidents thathave occurred orareoccurring .
Corrective (e.g.,installation ofupdates/fix) :Tofixissues after a
security incident hasoccurred .
Deterrent (e.g.,Dogs, video surveillance) :Todiscourage potential
attackers from attempting abreach .
Recovery (e.g.,Disaster Recovery ,Backup) :Torestore systems and
data toaprevious state after anincident .
Compensating (e.g.,utilization Video surveillance instead ofDogs) :
Toprovide analternative solution when theprimary control isnot
feasible .Cybersecurity Risk: Types of Security Controls
51
Risk Concepts
Adequate Protection:
Assets must beprotected with security controls until
they lose value.
Used security controls should match theasset’s value.
Principle ofeffectiveness :anysecurity control must be
efficient, easy touse, andappropriate forthecontext .
Principle ofweakest link:Security level can beno
stronger than itsweakest link.Cybersecurity Risk: Principles of effective security controls

53
Security Attacks : Four Fundamental Types 
■Interruption
■DoS (Denial ofService),
Destruction of some
hardware
■Interception
■Peeping eyes
■Modification
■Change ofexisting data
■Fabrication
■Addition of false or
spurious data
54
Security Attacks : Passive vs. Active
■Passive:
■Focusing oninterception without altering ordisrupting thedata or
services .
■Hard todetect because they don't disrupt normal operations
■Active: 
■Involving modification, interruption, andfabrication .
55
Traffic Sniffing: A Network Interception Attack
Traffic  (or packet) sniffing is a form of interception attack where an 
attacker captures and analyzes network traffic between two devices.
How it Happens:
■Misconfigured network devices may allow traffic tobebroadcasted ormirrored
tounauthorized devices .
■Using unsecured network where attackers canposition themselves tointercept
communications.
Protection measures: 
■Encryption
■Network Segmentation
■Monitoring
■…
56
MITM: A Network Modification Attack
A Man-in -the-Middle attack occurs when an attacker secretly 
intercepts and modifies communication between two parties without 
their knowledge. This allows the attacker to alter the transmitted data in real -time.
Examples of MITM in Network Security:
■HTTPS Spoofing :byimpersonating avalid SSL certificate .
■Wi-FiEavesdropping :using insecure Wi-Finetwork controlled bytheattacker
■DNS Spoofing :modification ofDNS responses
Protection measures: 
■Encryption
■Mutual authentication
57
Reply Attack: A Network fabrication attack
A Reply attack occurs when attacker intercepts valid data 
transmissions (e.g., authentication tokens or transactions) and 
resends them later to trick the system into granting unauthorized 
access or executing unauthorized actions.
Example: replaying the transaction request packets could result in double payments or unauthorized transactions.
Protection measures: 
■Timestamps &Nonces
■Secure Session Tokens
■MFA
■Message Authentication Codes (MACs)
58
DOS: A Network interruption attack
A DoS attack is an attempt to make a network service unavailable by 
overwhelming the system with excessive requests, leading to system 
slowdowns or complete shutdown.
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): multiple compromised devices 
(often forming a botnet) are used to flood the target system with traffic 
from various locations, making it harder to stop.
Example:
■HTTP Flooding :Repeated requests toweb servers overwhelm thebandwidth
orserver capacity .
■SYN Flood Attack: Sending anoverwhelming number ofconnection requests to
consume server resources .
Protection measures: 
■Firewalls,
■DDoS Protection Services
■Rate Limiting, Load Balancers, …
59
60It is time to work : Test Your Knowledge!
Take some time to figure out how the following Denial of Service 
(DoS) Attack Techniques work? Start from remembering how the 
concerned network protocol nd its main request & reply packets
■TCP SYN Flood
■Smurf IPAttack
■ICMP Flood
■Ping ofDeath
How can an attacker impersonate an SSL certificate to realize a 
Man- in-the-Middle (MITM) attack?
■What aretheconditions necessary tomake thisattack successful?
■Consider theroleoftrust inCertificate Authorities (CAs), domain name
spoofing, andSSL/TLS vulnerabilities .
60
Proactive Measures for Network Security
No system is immune to attacks. However, there are 
measures that must be taken:
■Risk Assessment :regularly conduct risk assessments to
identify and evaluate potential vulnerabilities within network
infrastructure .
■Continuous Monitoring :Implement continuous monitoring
solutions todetect unusual activities orpotential threats in
real-time.
■Incident Response Planning :Develop and maintain an
incident response plan that includes clear protocols for
identifying, isolating, andmitigating attacks .
■Security Training: Ensure that allteam members are
trained onthe latest cybersecurity threats and best
practices .Regular training sessions can help prevent
attacks such asphishing.
61
Proactive Measures for Network Security Cont.
■Update and Patch Management :Keep allsystems,
applications, andnetwork devices updated with thelatest
security patches andupdates .
■Use Advanced Security Tools :Deploy advanced security
solutions likefirewalls, intrusion detection &prevention
systems (IDS/IPS)
■Backup andDisaster Recovery :Maintain regular backups
andhave arobust disaster recovery plan torestore data
andservices quickly incase ofanattack .
■Implement Strict Access Controls :Use least privilege and
role-based access controls tominimize exposure to
potential internal andexternal attacks .
62
What to Do If Attacked?
No system is immune to attacks; even the most 
sophisticated systems can be breached. Security experts 
must accept that perfect security doesn’t exist.
Key Actions to Minimize Harm:
■Neutralize theThreat :Actively stop theattack inprogress, such
asisolating compromised subnetworks
■Close theVulnerability :Patch ormitigate thevulnerability that
wasexploited toprevent recurrence .
■RE-EVALUATE YOUR PROACTIVE MEASURES
63
Model for Network Security
64
Key Design Decisions in Network Security
Where to focus security controls
■Data: Protect sensitive data atrest, intransit, andinprocessing .
■Operations :safeguarding business operations i.e.,how anorganization
functions day-to-dayandinteracts withitstechnological infrastructure.
■Users :protection against unauthorized access byimplementing e.g.,identity
and access management (IAM), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and user
behavior monitoring
Where to place the security controls
■They must span multiple layers —from hardware and applications totheOS
anditskernel.
65
Key Design Decisions in Network Security Cont.
Complexity or Assurance
■Doweprefer simplicity and higher assurance toafeature -rich security
environment?
Centralize or decentralize control
■Centralized :Easier toachieve uniformity across systems butcan lead to
bottlenecks andsingle points offailure .
■Decentralized :Distributes responsibility, making thesystem more resilient,
though potentially harder tomaintain uniformity .
